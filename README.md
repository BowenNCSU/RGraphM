# RGraphM
 This is a wrapper package for the graph matching library GraphM. The original graphm C++ library can be found in http://cbio.mines-paristech.fr/graphm/ . Latest version ( 0.52 ) of graphm is slightly modified to fit Rcpp usage.
 Thanks to Mikhail.Zaslavskiy , Francis.Bach , Jean-Philippe.Vert for their hard work.
 Please feel free to make suggestions to make the R package more usable
